# Coding Challenge

Seen has provided you with an [API to retrieve a set of sample transactions](https://cdn.seen.com/challenge/transactions-v2.json). Using this data, we want you to build a simple Node.js application that enriches this data.

- The application should be written in Typescript and use Node.js.
- Any framework can be used (i.e. Koa, Express, Nest) but your choice of
- framework should be appropriate to the task below. You can assume that the
- complexity and scope of the task will not significantly grow in future.
- Your submission should include tests
- Your submission should work. npm start should work.
- No frontend or database is required.
